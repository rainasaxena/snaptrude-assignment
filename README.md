### Goal:
The aim is to create a Babylon.js application that allows users to draw 2D shapes on a ground plane, extrude them into 3D objects with a fixed height, and manipulate those objects by moving or editing their vertices, using mode selection buttons.

### Features:

- A 3D scene with a ground plane.
- Users can draw 2D shapes on the ground plane using mouse interactions:
  - Left-click to add points.
  - Right-click to close the shape.
- A "Draw" button to enable drawing mode.
- An "Extrude" button to extrude closed 2D shapes into 3D objects with a height of 5 units.
- A "Move" button to move extruded shapes across the ground plane.
- An "Edit" button to modify the vertices of extruded shapes using the mouse.
- Visual indicators and UI elements to show the selected object and the active mode.

### How to run the application:

1. Extract the `.zip` file.
2. Open the HTML file in your browser using **Live Server** to view the application.
